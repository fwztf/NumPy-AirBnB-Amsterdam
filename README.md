# NumPy-AirBnB-Amsterdam
# My initial data science project organized by Corise (Python for Data Science) utilizing the NumPy library for cleaning, reading, and processing of AirBnB (Amsterdam) data, followed by the utilization of StreamLit and Pandas for developing an interactive application using the processed data.
# It's an intuitive app hosted using StreamLit
